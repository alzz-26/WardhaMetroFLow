# WardhaMetroFlow 🚇

An AI-powered metro simulation for the city of Wardha. It offers two views: Passenger View to plan routes and get smart suggestions, and Admin View to monitor traffic, manage stations, and analyze predictions (helping visualize a smarter transit future).

# WardhaMetroFlow 🚇

WardhaMetroAI is an AI-powered metro simulation project built for the city of Wardha. It offers two interactive views:

- **Passenger View**: Plan metro routes, get real-time smart suggestions, and estimate arrival times.
- **Admin View**: Monitor metro traffic, manage stations, and analyze trends using predictive AI models.

This project envisions smarter, AI-driven public transit systems for emerging smart cities like Wardha.

###  System Architecture

Here's a overview of how the different components of WardhaMetroFlow interact:

![System Architecture](static/Architecture.png)

- **Frontend** (React) communicates with the **Flask backend**
- **Backend** serves API routes and logic
- **Database** (SQLite) stores metro and passenger data
- **ML Model** (`model.pkl`) is used by the backend to make route or traffic predictions

>  The diagram is located at `static/Architecture.png`. You can update it anytime using Visily, draw.io or Figma.
