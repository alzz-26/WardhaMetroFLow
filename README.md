# WardhaMetroFlow 

An AI-powered metro simulation for the city of Wardha. It offers two views: Passenger View to plan routes and get smart suggestions, and Admin View to monitor traffic, manage stations, and analyze predictions (helping visualize a smarter transit future).

It offers two interactive views:

- **Passenger View**: Plan metro routes, get real-time smart suggestions, and estimate arrival times.
- **Admin View**: Monitor metro traffic, manage stations, and analyze trends using predictive AI models.

This project envisions smarter, AI-driven public transit systems for emerging smart cities like Wardha.

## About the Project
WardhaMetroFlow is an AI-powered metro simulation project built for the city of Wardha. It envisions a smarter public transport system for emerging smart cities by using AI-driven metro route planning and traffic prediction.


## Features 
- Interactive metro route planner
- Real-time passenger & station simulation
- AI-based route optimization & predictions
- Passenger & Admin dashboards
- Voice/text input (optional)
- Modular and scalable codebase

###  System Architecture

Here's a overview of how the different components of WardhaMetroFlow interact:

![System Architecture](static/Architecture.png)

- **Frontend** (React) communicates with the **Flask backend**
- **Backend** serves API routes and logic
- **Database** (SQLite) stores metro and passenger data
- **ML Model** (`model.pkl`) is used by the backend to make route or traffic predictions

>  The diagram is located at `static/Architecture.png`. You can update it anytime using Visily, draw.io or Figma.
